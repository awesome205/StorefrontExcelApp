Notes from the Excel Documentation:

To put runtime logging from the command line, this is how it works:

- npx office-addin-dev-settings runtime-log --enable
- npx office-addin-dev-settings runtime-log --enable [filename.txt]
- defaults write com.microsoft.Excel CEFRuntimeLoggingFile -string "runtime_logs.txt"
open ~/library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/runtime_logs.txt
- Need to go into the folder above to find the runtime logs
